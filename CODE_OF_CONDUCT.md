We strive to provide a positive and harassment-free experience for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate in all communications and interactions.

- Use of derogatory or discriminatory language or imagery.

- Disrespecting differing viewpoints and experiences.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Additionally, project maintainers may temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [mail@rsl.com.np]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
